# About this repository
The course BSc Medical Image Processing I in the 2024 spring semester consisted of roughly 50 % lectures and 50 % programming. During the practical part, it was demonstrated how to implement the theory in python. Based on these demonstrations, students had to do similar exercises at home.

**Example:**

| Name | Explanation|
